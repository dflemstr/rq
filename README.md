# `rq` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dflemstr/rq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dflemstr/rq) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/aq916pu1odthadeh?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dflemstr/rq) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/record-query.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/record-query) [![Language (Rust)](https://img.shields.io/badge/powered_by-Rust-blue.svg)](http://www.rust-lang.org/)
**NOTE**: `rq` is in very low maintenance mode as my day job is taking up
a lot of my time.  I will try my best to merge pull requests but will
not drive active development of this crate.

**NOTE**: `rq` no longer ships with query support and a Javascript
engine is not included; instead, it focuses exclusively on format
transformation.  You can still pipe into a runtime like node.js if
you need Javascript evaluation.  Please see [this issue](https://github.com/dflemstr/rq/issues/208)
to discuss introducing a new query language.

This is the home of the tool called `rq` (record query).  It's a tool
that's used for performing queries on streams of records in various
formats.

The goal is to make ad-hoc exploration of data sets easy without
having to use more heavy-weight tools like SQL/MapReduce/custom
programs.  `rq` fills a similar niche as tools like `awk` or `sed`,
but works with structured (record) data instead of text.

It was created with love out of the best parts of Rust, and is
distributed as a dependency-free binary on many operating systems and
architectures.
